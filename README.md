## Notes for instructor
*Finally I caught up with everything but barely.  I was very sick after my mom passed away with my blood pressure shooting up over 200 but after CT scan and all other tests, I was declared okay.  Tried to rest as much as possible and could not work as much as I wanted.  Now I need to catch up E31 and it is more challenging with less time...
